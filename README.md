### Creating Pins

Pins are able to be created through a form where a user is able to upload an image, create a title and describe the image.

Once the image has been saved the homepage updates and gets populated with all pins created from all users.

### Editing Pins

When viewing pins if the current user is the creator of that pin they are allowed to edit the title and description or delete the pin all together.
