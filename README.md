### Creating Pins

Pins are able to be created through a form where users are able to upload an image, create a name for the pin and describe the pin if they choose to.

Once a pin has been created the homepage updates and gets populated with pins created from all users.

### Editing Pins

When viewing pins, if the user is also the creator the pin, they are allowed permission to edit the title and description or delete the pin all together.
